I am excited to apply for the Senior Machine Learning Engineer position at Apple. I have a total of 5 years of experience in machine learning, with a focus on developing and implementing machine learning models. At Intel, I was part of a team that developed a machine learning model for product recommendation. At Netflix, I worked on improving the accuracy of the movie recommendation algorithm. I have a strong background in Python and experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch. I am confident that my skills and experience will be a great fit for your team.
