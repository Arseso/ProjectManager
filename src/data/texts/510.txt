I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Java Developer position at Google. With over five years of experience in Java and Spring Boot, I believe I could make a significant contribution to your team. At XYZ, I developed robust and scalable Java applications, and at ABC, I led a team of developers to deliver high-quality software solutions. I am proficient in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, SQL, and AWS. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to discussing my candidacy further.
